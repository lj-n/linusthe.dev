Small Deno script to calculate the amount of time you wasted playing Steam games. ⏱

## Why?

I've been missing the feature on Steam that allows me to see the total number of hours I've played. After a fast google search I found [steamtime](https://steamtime.info/), but I don't want to make my profile public (I don't want anyone to see my game hours 😅).

A Steam web api key is pretty easy to get, so I wrote a little script that sums your total hours played.

> While testing, I found that you can even calculate the total hours of your friends. But please use with discretion!

## Requirements

First Install [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.30.0/getting_started/installation).

Go [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and log into your steam account, then proceed to create an api key. As domain url just use _127.0.0.1_.

Finally get the user ID of the profile for which you want to sum up the hours.

## Hot to use

> 🛸 The profile associated with the number should be the profile that generated the API key **or** public.

```zsh
deno run -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lj-n/wasted-time-playing-games/main/mod.ts --apiKey="Steam Api Key here" --steamId="Steam User ID here"
```

Should result in something like this:

```zsh
🎲 Found 178 Games, with a total playtime of 4295 hours!

Your three most played games are:
┌──────────────────────────────────┬────────┐
│ (idx)                            │ Values │
├──────────────────────────────────┼────────┤
│ Dota 2                           │   1787 │
│ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive │    418 │
│ Counter-Strike: Source           │    221 │
└──────────────────────────────────┴────────┘
```
