# Particle Effect with JavaScript and HTML Canvas

Whether you want fancy effects on your website, or are developing a JavaScript game, particle effects can spice things up.
In this tutorial you will learn how to create simple particle effects with plain JavaScript and the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
This tutorial requires some basic JavaScript knowledge, but is very beginner friendly.

The full code for this tutorial is at the [end](#the-code) of this article.

## The Canvas

First we create the HTML `canvas` element and reference it in our JavaScript. We
give it a fixed height and width, in this case the size of our viewport. The
values will equal the pixels on the axes. You can style the canvas size with CSS
but this will just scale the rendered image and can distort your graphics. Then
we get the drawing context with `getContext()`.

> The Context is part of [the Canvas Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) and is used for drawing shapes, text, images and other objects.

```js
// html
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>;

//js
const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;

const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
```

## The Particle

Now we create a `class Particle`, which will be the template for our particle objects.
The constructor method will be passed a `x`- and `y`-coordinate.
The Particles in this tutorial will be circles so we also add a field `r` for the radius in the constructor method.
For now the radius will always be `10`.

```js
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = 10;
  }
}

const p = new Particle(2, 4); // { x: 2, y: 4, r: 10 }
```

Next we create a class method `draw` that _draws_ the particle on the canvas.

```js
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = 10;
  }

  draw() {
    context.fillStyle = "#818cf8";
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.r, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
}
```

- `fillStyle` specifies the color, gradient, or pattern to use for drawing.
- `beginPath` starts a new path to draw.
- `arc` adds an _arc_ to the current path.
  It takes a x- and y-coordinate, a radius, a start angle and an end angle as parameters: `arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle)`.
  Since we want a whole circle we start at an angle of `0` and end at `2Ï€`.
- `fill` fills the current path with the current `fillStyle`.

Now that we are able to draw on the canvas, we can add an `click` event listener to the canvas element.

```js
function addParticle(ev) {
  // get the x- and y-coordinate from the Mouse Event
  const pa = new Particle(ev.x, ev.y);
  pa.draw();
}

canvas.addEventListener("click", addParticle);
```

We pass our mouse coordinates from the event as arguments when we create a new instance of our `Particle` class.
Then we call the `draw` method on the instance, to draw on our canvas.

> Small note: If your canvas is not the size of your viewport, you have to get the _relative_ position of your mouse.
> You can use the Element method [getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect).

```js
function handleClick(ev) {
  const { left, top } = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  const relativeMousePosition = {
    x: ev.clientX - left,
    y: ev.clientY - top,
  };
}
```

Now we are able to draw our first particles, **well done!**

## The Loop

Static circles aren't very interesting. We will add some animation to them.
For this we need an animation _loop_.

We could use `setInterval` to update the particles every given number of milliseconds.
The problem is that this does not take into account the performance of the device.
This is where [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) comes in.
`requestAnimationFrame` is a method that schedules a function to be called on the next available animation frame.
It ensures that our animation is synchronized with the refresh rate of our device, resulting in a ðŸ§ˆ-smooth animation:

```js
function loop() {
  // we will update and draw our particles here

  // continue the loop
  window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}

// start the loop once
window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
```

To draw and update multiple particles each loop, we create an `particles` array and update our `addParticle` function:

```js
let particles = [];

function addParticle(ev) {
  // get the x- and y-coordinate from the Mouse Event
  const pa = new Particle(ev.x, ev.y);
  particles.push(pa);
}
```

Now we are able to iterate over the particles in our loop

```js
function loop() {
  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.draw();
  }

  window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

> They are still static and and nothing moves?!

Yes, this is because we aren't changing our particles yet.
Let's animate our particles size:
For this we update each particle's radius `r` every loop.
Before we draw them, we make sure to _remove_ any particles with a radius smaller than `0.1`.

```js
function loop() {
  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.r -= 0.2; // decrease particles radius
  }

  // just keep particles where r > 0.1
  particles = particles.filter((pa) => pa.r > 0.1);

  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.draw();
  }

  window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

> But wait, at my friend's display the particles are animating a lot faster!

This is because your friends monitor has a different refresh rate and the `loop` function is called more often.

As we rember this is actually an advantage of `requestAnimationFrame`.
We just have to decrease our particles radius **_relative to the time that passed_** instead of a fixed amount every frame.

To do this `requestAnimationFrame` gives you the tool to calculate the passed time:
a pretty [precise timestamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp).
The `timestamp` is passed as the first argument to the callback function.
We will use this timestamp to calculate the `elapsedTime` since the last frame and update our particles accordingly.

```js
// save the timestamp of the last frame
let lastFrame = 0;

function loop(timestamp) {
  // get the elapsed time in seconds
  let elapsedTime = (timestamp - lastFrame) / 1000;
  lastFrame = timestamp;

  for (const pa of particles) {
    // decrease particles radius by 10/s
    pa.r -= elapsedTime * 10;
  }

  // ...
}
```

Because the `timestamp` is in milliseconds we divide by 1000 to calculate the seconds that have passed since the last frame.

One more thing you should know about `requestAnimationFrame` is, that it will pause once you minimize the browser window or go into another tab.
This will cause the `elapsedTime` to be so vast, that it will mess up your animations.

Let's use `Math.min` to ensures that the `elapsedTime` will not surpass `0.1`.

```js
function loop(timestamp) {
  // get the elapsed time in seconds
  let elapsedTime = Math.min((timestamp - lastFrame) / 1000, 0.1);
  lastFrame = timestamp;

  // ...
}
```

For consistency we will add an `update` method to the `Particle` class:

```js
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y) {
    // ...
  }

  draw() {
    // ..
  }

  update(elapsedTime) {
    this.r -= elapsedTime * 10;
  }
}
```

Now we call the method in our loop, which at this point should look like this.

```js
function loop(timestamp) {
  let elapsedTime = Math.min((timestamp - lastFrame) / 1000, 0.1);
  lastFrame = timestamp;

  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.update(elapsedTime);
  }

  particles = particles.filter((pa) => pa.r > 0.1);

  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.draw();
  }

  window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

We also have to call `clearRect(x, y, width, height)` in the loop to clear the drawings of the previous frame.
The rectangle's top-left corner is at `x`, `y`. Its size is specified by `width` and `height`.

**Great!** We have our first animated particles ðŸŽ‰.

## The Effect

Now to the last part: We want to create a _small explosion_ of particles ðŸ’¥.

To move them in different direction the particles need a velocity.
For this we add the fields `vx` and `vy` to our Particle class.
We will set some random values so it doesn't look to stiff.
Let's also change the radius to a random value to create different sized particles.

```js
// Random Value between 200 and -200
this.vy = Math.random() * 400 - 200;
this.vx = Math.random() * 400 - 200;
// Random Value between 20 and 1
this.r = Math.random() * 20 + 1;
```

At last we have to add the velocities to our particle's position in its `update` method.

Our finished class looks like this:

```js
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vy = Math.random() * 400 - 200;
    this.vx = Math.random() * 400 - 200;
    this.r = Math.random() * 20 + 1;
  }
  draw() {
    context.fillStyle = "#818cf8";
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.r, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
  update(elapsedTime) {
    this.x += this.vx * elapsedTime;
    this.y += this.vy * elapsedTime;
    this.r -= elapsedTime + 0.2;
  }
}
```

Now all we have to do is create a lot of particles when we click the canvas.
Lets change the `addParticle` function accordingly:

```js
function addParticle(ev) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    const pa = new Particle(ev.x, ev.y);
    particles.push(pa);
  }
}
```

Congrats! There you have a simple particle effect âœ¨.

  lastFrame = timestamp;

  // update all particles
  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.update(elapsedTime);
  }

  // keep only particles with radius > 0.1
  particles = particles.filter((pa) => pa.r > 0.1);

  // clear canvas
  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  // draw all particles
  for (const pa of particles) {
    pa.draw();
  }

  // continue loop
  window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}

// create 60 particles at mouse position
function addParticle(ev) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    const pa = new Particle(ev.x, ev.y);
    particles.push(pa);
  }
}

canvas.addEventListener("click", addParticle);

// start the loop
window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
