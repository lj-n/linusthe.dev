With CSS and JavaScript, it's possible to create animations that are relative to the mouse position.
In this article I will show how to use these technologies to create engaging and interactive animations that respond to the movement of the user's mouse.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll discover how to bring your website to life with this exciting example.

## CSS-Variables

CSS Variables, also known as CSS Custom Properties, allow you to store values that can be reused throughout your CSS code.

```css
:root {
  --my-button-color: salmon;
}

button {
  background: var(--my-button-color);
}

button:hover {
  --my-button-color: hotpink;
}
```

By using JavaScript, you can update the values of these variables in real-time, creating dynamic and interactive animations.

## The goal

After this tutorial you will be able to animate something like this:

<Demo client:load/>

> These examples will only work if you are using a mouse.

## Setup

First lets make sure we have a html element to animate.

```html
<div id="myElement">
  <span>Hello CSS Variables</span>
</div>
```

Then create a reference in JavaScript.

```js
const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
```

And some basic CSS so we can see something.

```css
#myElement {
  padding: 4rem;
  border: 1px solid purple;
  display: flex;
}

#myElement span {
  margin: auto; /* My favorite way to center things */
}
```
